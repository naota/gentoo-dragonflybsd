implement limited support for static ELFs with ptrace ?

cache results of filesystem checks

add tests to make sure errno is saved/restored properly

wrappers for execl{,l,p} ... unfortunately, we'll probably have to basically
reimplement the functions (building up argv[] and then call the execv* ver)
